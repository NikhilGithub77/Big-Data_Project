In recent weeks, the faces of our trading floor have been seen on the front pages of newspapers from New York to Tokyo. Our real-time market data is on constant display across television news and social media.\n\nFrom my conversations with investors — ranging from everyday retail traders to the world's largest asset managers — I thoroughly understand the challenges posed by the recent market turmoil.\n\nSeparate from the ups and downs of our markets, though, Americans should feel assured by another trend from recent weeks: The infrastructure and operational practices underpinning our markets are the envy of the world and have met the challenge posed by recent volatility.\n\nU.S. markets come from humble beginnings. The New York Stock Exchange was started in 1792 by a group of twenty-four stockbrokers who met outdoors under a buttonwood tree. That has evolved from a structure which was once dominated by people shouting \"buy\" or \"sell\" to one that today blends the best of human judgment interacting with state-of-the-art technology.\n\nSince April 3, our designated market makers have taken manual control of the opening and closing auctions at more than two times their usual rate to mitigate the market's extreme volatility. This flexibility, unique to our model, has fostered greater engagement from market participants, with NYSE's opening and closing auctions growing more than 20% to handle over 32 billion dollars in trading activity per day.\n\nWe've also seen trades settle and clear more efficiently than the last time our systems were battle tested. Following the Covid-19 market sell-off, the exchange industry accelerated the time to settle trades from two days to one — increasing certainty and diminishing risk.\n\nWith dramatic swings in the Dow, S&P 500 and other major indices, U.S. exchanges are absorbing a record number of transactions and volume. At the New York Stock Exchange, we have struck a record volume of trades on our exchanges three times in the last seven days — peaking on April 9 with over 30 billion shares exchanged hands.\n\nOn April 7 and April 9, we processed more than 1 trillion incoming orders to buy or sell shares in a single day, with a median processing time of around 30 microseconds. Said differently, efficient certainty of execution has never been more crucial from a risk management perspective and the ecosystem has risen to the occasion.\n\nAmid great uncertainty, our markets have provided investors with the freedom to digest global events, make investment decisions and execute trades with unrivaled speed and accuracy.\n\nIt is no accident that our system is working. It's a system we have built and refined over more than two centuries. We make constant, immense investments in our technology. We push our teams to innovate. We prepare for every crisis imaginable.\n\nIn moments of uncertainty like these, we are constantly guided our north star of protecting the integrity of the U.S. market infrastructure. We rely on our reserve of knowledge and our experience to ensure the market's strength and resiliency and the collective efforts from the financial industry maintain the U.S.'s position as the largest and most robust financial market in the world.\n\nWhen it comes to risk management, and what it takes to run the largest and most robust markets in the world, Henry Ford got it right."}

It's not tied to an index.\n\n\"What we try to do is help investors leverage the upside through sector rotation, but also minimize drawdowns,\" the Fairlead Strategies founder told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week. \"That's obviously a big advantage longer term when you can just go into a less deep hole to climb out of.\"\n\nAccording to Stockton, her ETF is particularly nimble in this environment because it uses multiple strategies — not just one. Since President Donald Trump announced his \"reciprocal\" tariffs on April 2, the ETF has fallen just over 4%, while the S&P 500 has lost 6.9%.\n\nStockton's ETF rotates monthly between all 11 S&P 500 sectors.\n\n\"We don't own technology anymore,\" Stockton said. \"Some of the sectors that we like to invest in have fallen out of favor.\"\n\nAs of April 16, the fund's top sector holdings included consumer staples , utilities and real estate , according to Fairlead Strategies.\n\nAs of Thursday's close, the Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF is down 4% so far this year.\n\nMeanwhile, ETFs that are centered around specific sectors or strategies are largely under pressure. For example, the Invesco Top QQQ Trust (QBIG), which tracks the top 45% of companies in the Nasdaq-100 index, is down 22% in 2025.\n\nThe GraniteShares YieldBoost TSLA ETF (TSYY) is off 48% since the beginning of the year.\n\nBTIG's Troy Donohue, the firm's head of Americas portfolio trading, thinks Stockton's ETF employs a sound strategy – particularly during the recent \"dramatic pullback.\"\n\n\"TACK is a great example of how you can be nimble during these market times,\" Donohue said. \"It's great to see it in an ETF product that has performed really well during this recent drawdown.\""}

Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nInvestors may feel an impulse to move to cash amid the recent tumult in the stock market. While cash might feel safer than stocks, it can also pose risks for long-term savers, financial advisors say. Cash — like money held in a high-yield bank savings account or a money market fund — is substantially less volatile than stocks over the short term, experts said. But cash has historically delivered lower returns than stocks over the long term. Holding on to more cash than you need — rather than investing it — raises the risk that you may not achieve your investing goals. The upshot: Cash-heavy investors may find it challenging to achieve their long-term investment goals, and may have to save more of their discretionary income as a result, Vanguard wrote in a paper that analyzed stock and cash returns.\n\nInvestors fled stocks for perceived safe havens as U.S. stock benchmarks were whipsawed by tariff and trade proclamations from the Trump administration and retaliatory measures announced by major trade partners like China. Following a White House announcement of country-specific tariffs earlier this month, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day stretch since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, losing about 11%. Meanwhile, April 7 saw the highest volume of 401(k) plan trading since March 12, 2020, according to Alight Solutions, a retirement plan administrator. About 94% of proceeds moved to conservative assets like money market, bond and stable-value funds, according to Alight.\n\nThe pros and cons of cash\n\nCash does have some benefits. For instance, it's there when investors need money for emergencies and major purchases, even if there's an upheaval in the stock market, said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida. \"Everyone should have some cash and some equities,\" McClanahan, a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council, wrote in an email. But cash \"has a long history\" of offering negative \"real\" returns, meaning returns after accounting for inflation, according to Morningstar. In other words, consumers who hold a portfolio that's 100% in cash actually lose wealth over time after accounting for inflation, experts said. If interest rates on cash don't keep pace with rising prices, consumers lose purchasing power. Meanwhile, stocks have the potential for high growth, especially over the long term, but also come with risks, McClanahan said.

They should also hold any cash they might need for purchases in the next five years, like a home down payment, car purchase or tuition expenses, she said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe rest should be allocated to stocks and bonds based on their time horizon, as well as their \"financial and psychological ability to take risk,\" McClanahan said. For example, someone with 10 years to retirement should have a lower share of their portfolio in stocks relative to someone 30 years from retirement, she said. People in or near retirement, when they will need to start withdrawing money from their portfolio, should hold enough money in cash, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit to fund five years of income needs, plus any upcoming major purchases, McClanahan said. The rest should be in a diversified portfolio of fixed income and stocks, she said."}

Kevney, the acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services and Thomas E. Wheeler, the acting general counsel of the Department of Education.\n\nA Harvard spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that \"the letter that Harvard received on Friday, April 11, was signed by three federal officials, placed on official letterhead, was sent from the e-mail inbox of a senior federal official, and was sent on April 11 as promised.\"\n\n\"Recipients of such correspondence from the U.S. government—even when it contains sweeping demands that are astonishing in their overreach—do not question its authenticity or seriousness,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"It remains unclear to us exactly what, among the government's recent words and deeds, were mistakes or what the government actually meant to do and say,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"But even if the letter was a mistake, the actions the government took this week have real-life consequences on students, patients, employees, and the standing of American higher education in the world.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the New York Times report.\n\nThe April 11 letter set off a public feud between the White House and Harvard.\n\nThe university on Monday rejected the White House's demands that were put forth in the April 11 letter, putting almost $9 billion in federal funding for the university at risk.\n\nThe White House quickly fired back and, in response, said it would freeze approximately $2.2 billion in grants to the university.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the April 11 letter came as lawyers at Harvard University were in dialogue with the White House about how the school handled antisemitism and other issues."}

Tariffs essentially act as a tax on imports, though their direct link to inflation historically has been spotty.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session after his speech, Powell said tariffs are \"likely to move us further away from our goals ... probably for the balance of this year.\"\n\nPowell gave no indication on where he sees interest rates headed, but noted that, \"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\"\n\nStocks hit session lows as Powell spoke while Treasury yields turned lower.\n\nIn the case of higher inflation, the Fed would keep interest rates steady or even increase them to dampen demand. In the case of slower growth, the Fed might be persuaded to lower interest rates. Powell emphasized the importance to keeping inflation expectations in check.\n\nMarkets expect the Fed to start reducing rates again in June and to enact three or four quarter percentage point cuts by the end of 2025, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.\n\nFed officials generally consider tariffs to be a one-time hit to prices, but the expansive nature of the Trump duties could alter that trend.\n\nPowell noted that survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation are on the rise, though the longer-term outlook remains close to the Fed's 2% goal. The Fed's key inflation measure is expected to show a rate of 2.6% for March, he said.\n\n\"Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" said Powell. \"The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.\"\n\nThe speech was largely similar to one he delivered earlier this month in Virginia, and in some passages verbatim.\n\nPowell noted the threats to growth as well as inflation.\n\nGross domestic product for the first quarter, which will be reported later this month, is expected to show little growth in the U.S. economy for the January-through-March period.\n\nIndeed, Powell noted: \"The data in hand so far suggest that growth has slowed in the first quarter from last year's solid pace. Despite strong motor vehicle sales, overall consumer spending appears to have grown modestly. In addition, strong imports during the first quarter, reflecting attempts by businesses to get ahead of potential tariffs, are expected to weigh on GDP growth.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased a better-than-expected 1.4% in March. The report showed that a large portion of the growth came from car buyers looking to make purchases ahead of the tariffs, though multiple other sectors showed solid gains as well.\n\nFollowing the report, the Atlanta Fed said it sees GDP growing at a -0.1% pace in Q1 when adjusting for an unusual rise in gold imports and exports. Powell described the economy as being in a \"solid position\" even with the expected slowdown in growth.\n\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVE\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!\n\nUncertain markets?

The Cboe Volatility Index , a measure of stock market volatility over the next 30 days, is down nearly 50% from the peak of 60.13 it hit Wednesday. Even though the move coincides with the recent rebound in equities, Xu contends the market gyrations aren't over just yet. \"The macro outlook is a lot more uncertain going forward than what is priced into the equity market right now,\" the firm's derivatives market intelligence head told CNBC's \" Fast Money \" on Monday. Xu highlights an \"unusual\" circumstance where bond yields have moved higher along with stocks, with the 10-year Treasury Note yield briefly topping 4.5% on Friday as investors fled U.S. assets. \"Our VIX [20+ Year Treasury] TLT indicator, which measures volatility in the bond market, went up 60 points last week. It's retraced a little bit today, but it's still near multiyear highs,\" Xu added. The heightened activity could be flashing a warning signal about the macroeconomic environment, according to Xu. \"What we're seeing is more demand for puts in TLT, positioning for yields to go higher,\" she said. \"That really indicates an erosion of confidence in U.S. markets right now.\" On \"Fast Money\" in early March, Xu warned the stock market was underpricing tariff risks . She also noted the bond market was signaling a potential recession. 'The perfect storm' \"Fast Money\" trader Dan Nathan is chalking up the current heightened volatility backdrop to panic caused by tariff uncertainty. \"I don't think a lot of people were hedged up, and they were reaching for it once they saw a lot of different asset classes go haywire together,\" Nathan told \"Fast Money\" on Monday. \"Obviously, that's the dollar , that's yields and the stock market.

(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nBEIJING — China missed several key targets from its 10-year plan to become self-sufficient in technology, while fostering unhealthy industrial competition which worsened global trade tensions, the European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report this week. When Beijing released its \"Made in China 2025\" plan in 2015, it was met with significant international criticism for promoting Chinese business at the expense of their foreign counterparts. The country subsequently downplayed the initiative, but has doubled-down on domestic tech development given U.S. restrictions in the last several years. Since releasing the plan, China has exceeded its targets on achieving domestic dominance in autos, but the country has not yet reached its targets in aerospace, high-end robots and the growth rate of manufacturing value-added, the business chamber said, citing its research and discussions with members. Out of ten strategic sectors identified in the report, China only attained technological dominance in shipbuilding, high-speed rail and electric cars. China's targets are generally seen as a direction rather than an actual figure to be achieved by a specific date. The Made In China 2025 plan outlines the first ten years of what the country called a 'multi-decade strategy' to become a global manufacturing powerhouse. The chamber pointed out that China's self-developed airplane, the C919, still relies heavily on U.S. and European parts and though industrial automation levels have \"increased substantially,\" it is primarily due to foreign technology. In addition, the growth rate of manufacturing value add reached 6.1% in 2024, falling from the 7% rate in 2015 and just over halfway toward reaching the target of 11%. \"Everyone should consider themselves lucky that China missed its manufacturing growth target,\" Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters Tuesday, since the reverse would have exacerbated pressure on global competitors. \"They didn't fulfill their own target, but I actually think they did astoundingly well.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nEven at that slower pace, China has transformed itself over the last decade to drive 29% of global manufacturing value add — almost the same as the U.S. and Europe combined, Eskelund said. \"Before 2015, in many, many categories China was not a direct competitor of Europe and the United States.\" The U.S. in recent years has sought to restrict China's access to high-end tech, and encourage advanced manufacturing companies to build factories in America. Earlier this week, the U.S. issued exporting licensing requirements for U.S.-based chipmaker Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 artificial intelligence chips, as well as their equivalents, to China. Prior to that, Nvidia said that it would take a quarterly charge of about $5.5 billion as a result of the new exporting licensing requirements. The chipmaker's CEO Jensen Huang met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Beijing on Thursday, according to Chinese state media. The U.S. restrictions have \"pushed us to make things that previously we would not have thought we had to buy,\" said Lionel M. Ni, founding president of the Guangzhou campus of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks to reporters on Wednesday. Ni said the products requiring home-grown development efforts included chips and equipment, and if substitutes for restricted items weren't immediately available, the university would buy the second-best version available. In addition to thematic plans, China issues national development priorities every five years. The current 14th five-year plan emphasizes support for the digital economy and wraps up in December. The subsequent 15th five-year plan is scheduled to be released next year.\n\nChina catching up\n\nOvercapacity and security concerns\n\nHowever, high spending doesn't necessarily mean efficiency. The electric car race in particular has prompted a price war, with most automakers running losses in their attempt to undercut competitors. The phenomenon is often called \"neijuan\" or \"involution\" in China. \"We also need to realize [China's] success has not come without problems,\" Eskelund said. \"We are seeing across a great many industries it has not translated into healthy business.\" He added that the attempt to fulfill \"Made in China 2025\" targets contributed to involution, and pointed out that China's efforts to move up the manufacturing value chain from Christmas ornaments to high-end equipment have also increased global worries about security risks.\n\n\n\nSubscribe now Weekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox"}

On the other end of the credit spectrum, Synchrony Financial , which offers store cards for dozens of popular retailers, has warned of a spending slowdown.\n\n\"There's a lot of stability and strength, despite the news and the environment,\" Le Caillec said.\n\nGrowth at AmEx came from younger cardholders, with millennial and Gen Z members spending 14% more in the quarter. Gen X and Baby Boomer cardholders showed more caution, registering 5% and 1% increases, respectively.\n\nLe Caillec said it's difficult to discern whether cardholders were pulling forward purchases because of the looming tariffs, creating an artificial boost to purchase volumes, as JPMorgan executives said last week. But some small businesses may be doing so to build inventory because of concerns about the duties increasing costs, he added."}

In states with large urban centers like California, New York and Massachusetts, housing alone can cost $30,000 more per year than in less expensive areas, according to the data. As a result, retirees in those states need more savings to maintain their lifestyles.\n\nThe analysis looked at typical retiree expenses, including groceries, housing, transportation, utilities and health care, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023 Consumer Expenditure Survey. GOBankingRates adjusted those figures for each state using the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center's cost-of-living index to offer a more realistic picture of retirement spending.\n\nWhile $2 million is a high bar — only 1.8% of households have that much saved, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute — it covers more than 35 years of retirement in all but three states: Hawaii, Massachusetts and California.\n\nThat target isn't far off from most people's goals. Many consider roughly $1.5 million the \"magic number\" for retirement savings, according to a Northwestern Mutual survey of 4,588 Americans.\n\nHere's how long $2 million, plus average Social Security benefits, would last in each state, based on average annual expenses.

Here's what experts are saying","date":"2025-04-17 00:00:00","content":"watch now\n\nSome investors accustomed to the dominance of U.S. stocks versus the rest of the world are making a stunning pivot toward international equities, fearing U.S. assets may have taken on more risk amid escalating trade tensions initiated by President Donald Trump. The S&P 500 sank more than 6% since Trump first announced his tariff plan, while the Dow and Nasdaq have each tumbled more than 7%. There was a strong argument to dial back U.S. stock holdings and adopt a more global portfolio even before the recent volatility, said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar. \"But I think the case for international diversification is even greater [now], given recent developments,\" she said. Jacob Manoukian, head of U.S. investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, offered a similar assessment. \"Global diversification seems like a prudent strategy,\" he wrote in a research note on Monday.\n\nU.S. had the world beat by 'sizable margin'\n\nSome experts, however, don't think investors should be so quick to dump U.S. stocks and chase returns abroad. The United States is still \"a quality market that looks like a bargain,\" said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. U.S. stocks had been outperforming the world for years heading into 2025.\n\nwatch now\n\nIs U.S. exceptionalism dead?\n\nThe sharp sell-off in U.S. markets has raised doubts as to whether U.S. assets \"are as attractive to foreigners now as they once were and, perhaps as a consequence, whether 'U.S. [equity] market exceptionalism' could be on the way out,\" market analysts at Capital Economics wrote Thursday. At the same time, rising global trade tensions have taken a toll on the bond market, threatening to shake the confidence of holders of U.S. debt. The U.S. dollar has also weakened, nearing a one-year low as of Thursday morning. It's unusual for U.S. stocks, bonds and the dollar to fall at the same time, analysts said. Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday that President Donald Trump's tariffs have made it more difficult for Americans to find comfort in the U.S. financial system. \"This is really creating an environment in which households and businesses feel paralyzed by the uncertainty about what's going to happen,\" Yellen told CNBC during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"It makes planning almost impossible.\"\n\nThe U.S. fire had 'already been burning'\n\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell in New York City, on April 17, 2025. Timothy A. Clary | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThat said, international and U.S. stock returns tend to ebb and flow in cycles, with each showing multi-year periods of relative strength and weakness. Since 1975, U.S. stock returns have outperformed those of international stocks for stretches of about eight years, on average, according to an analysis by Hartford Funds through 2024. Then, U.S. stocks cede the mantle to international stocks, it said. Based on history, non-U.S. equities are overdue to reclaim the top spot: The U.S. is currently 13.8 years into the current cycle of stock outperformance, according to the Hartford Funds analysis.\n\nwatch now\n\nU.S. markets had already showed weakness heading into the year amid concerns about the health of the economy grew and as \"air came out the valuations of 'big-tech' stocks,\" according to Capital Economics analysts. \"In that respect, 'Liberation Day' — which accentuated these moves — only added fuel to a fire that had already been burning,\" they wrote.\n\nAdvisors: 'Tread carefully here'\n\nA good starting point for investors would be to mirror a global stock fund like the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund ETF (VT ), said Benz of Morningstar. That fund holds about 63% of assets in U.S. stocks and 37% in non-U.S. stocks. It may make sense to pare back exposure to international stocks as individual investors approach retirement, she said, to reduce the volatility that comes from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. \"Part of our core models for clients have always had international exposure, it's traditionally part of any risk-adjusted portfolio,\" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York, of the conversations he is having with his clients.\n\nFinancial advisor or business people meeting discussing financial figures.

Still, Boneparth cautions investors against making any sudden moves to add non-U.S. equities to their portfolios. \"If you are thinking about making changes now, be careful,\" he said. \"Do you lock in losses to U.S. stocks to gain international exposure? You want to tread carefully here,\" he said. \"Are you chasing or timing? You usually don't want to do those things.\" However, this may be a good time to check your investments to make sure you are still allocated properly and rebalance as needed, he added. \"By rebalancing, you can rotate out of less risky assets into equities, strategically buying the dip.\""}

The trading volume of 0DTE options tied to the S&P 500 surged to 8.5 million in April, a 23% jump since the beginning of the year and accounting for roughly 7% of the total volume in U.S. option markets, according to data from JPMorgan.\n\nWild intraday gyrations in stocks since \"liberation day\" have put investors more on edge than ever, and the popularity of zero-day-to-expiration options is partly to blame.\n\nVolatility surged as Trump introduced steep tariffs on key U.S. trading partners and repeatedly reversed and changed his own policy. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 posted its third-biggest gain in post-World War II history, following a four-day rout that briefly pushed it into bear market territory. Last week also saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall at least 1,500 points on back-to-back days, the first time in history.\n\nThe S&P 500's intraday volatility almost doubled last week to 44%, exceeding the 2020 highs and is now reaching levels last seen during the depth of the 2008 financial crisis, according to data from Cboe Global Markets.
