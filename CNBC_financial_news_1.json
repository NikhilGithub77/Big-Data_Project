However, the 1,400-square-foot home, in the Arlington Heights suburb northwest of Chicago, was built in the 1930s and lacked insulation — leading to heating bills that were \"very high,\" said Moritz, 48. The first-time homeowner opted to pay about $5,700 for a series of projects last year to make her home more energy-efficient. She added insulation to the walls, and sealed gaps in ductwork connected to her furnace to prevent air leaks. Moritz shaved her gas heating bill by half or more during the winter months, and her home is now \"delightfully toasty,\" she said. She slashed her bill to $102 in December 2024 from $311 two years earlier, records show. In January 2025, her bill was $116, down from $288 in 2023. Moritz also received a $1,200 federal tax break when she filed her tax return this year, according to records reviewed by CNBC. She's among millions of homeowners who claim a tax credit each year for retrofits tied to energy efficiency. More from Personal Finance:\n\nCan't pay your taxes by April 15? You have options\n\nThere's another surprise tax deadline on April 15\n\nThis tax strategy is a 'silver lining' amid tariff volatility \"The biggest perk to me, honestly, was not freezing my butt off,\" said Moritz, who works for a global professional association. \"Then it was the monthly bill going down as much as it did.\" \"The tax credit was a nice little perk, the cherry on top,\" she said. The tax break, however, may not be available for much longer. Republicans have signaled an intent to put the tax break and other consumer financial incentives linked to the Inflation Reduction Act on the chopping block to raise money for a multi-trillion-dollar package of tax cuts being negotiated on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhat is the tax break?\n\nThe tax break — the energy efficient home improvement credit, also known as the 25C credit — is worth up to 30% of the cost of a qualifying project. Taxpayers can claim up to $3,200 per year on their tax returns, with the overall dollar amount tied to specific projects. They can get up to $2,000 for installing a heat pump, heat pump water heater or biomass stove/boiler, and another $1,200 for other additions like efficient air conditioners, efficient windows and doors, insulation and air sealing. About 2.3 million taxpayers claimed the credit on their 2023 tax returns, according to Internal Revenue Service data. The average family claimed about $880, according to the Treasury Department.\n\n'A much harder decision'\n\nA thermal scan of Megan Moritz's Chicago area home shows areas of energy inefficiency. ARC Insulation\n\nBlair Kennedy, a homeowner in Severna Park, Maryland, plans to claim a credit when he files his tax return next year. Kennedy, 38, had fiberglass insulation installed in his attic and air-sealed his 3,700-square-foot home in March, a project that cost just over $6,000 after state and local rebates. A federal tax break would reduce his net cost to about $5,000, Kennedy expects. \"I think it would've been a much harder decision to do it\" without tax credits, said Kennedy, a real estate agent. The tax break has been available on-and-off since Congress passed the Federal Energy Tax Act of 1978, according to a paper by Severin Borenstein and Lucas Davis, economists at the Haas Energy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe original rationale for the credit was to boost U.S. energy security following energy crises in the 1970s, they wrote. Today, the main goal of the tax break is to mitigate climate change, Davis said in an interview. Making homes more energy-efficient helps reduce their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Residential energy use accounts for about 20% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to researchers in the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan. The Inflation Reduction Act — a historic law to combat climate change, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022 — extended the tax break through 2032 and made it more generous. Biden-era Treasury officials said the tax break was more popular than expected. \"A lot of these clean-energy technologies have significant benefits, but they can tend to cost a bit more than the alternative,\" Davis said. \"This [tax] credit offers an incentive to spend a little bit more for a capital investment that will yield climate benefits.\" Households can only claim the tax credit if they have an annual tax liability, since the credit is nonrefundable. Most of the benefits accrue to higher-income households, which are more likely to have a tax liability, Davis said.\n\nRisk of disappearance\n\nNes | E+ | Getty Images\n\nThe IRA also included many other consumer tax breaks and financial incentives tied to electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels and energy efficiency. Republicans in Congress may claw back funding as part of a forthcoming tax-cut package expected to cost at least $4 trillion, experts said. President Donald Trump pledged to gut IRA funding on the campaign trail, and Republicans voted more than 50 times in the House of Representatives to repeal parts of the law. \"Absolutely, there is a risk in the current budget bill that these credits would be changed or go away completely,\" Davis said. However, there's a group of Republicans in the House and Senate seeking to preserve the tax breaks. Their support could be enough to save the incentives, given slim margins in each chamber. About 85% of the clean-energy investments and 68% of jobs tied to Inflation Reduction Act funding are in Republican congressional districts, according to a 2024 study by E2.\n\nMoving forward without tax break\n\nMany households would likely still undergo energy-efficiency projects even if the tax breaks disappear, Davis said. Savings on utility bills are often a primary motivation, experts said. There's generally a five- to 10-year return on investment given monthly energy savings, said Ryan Warkentien, head of ARC Insulation, which did the retrofit on Moritz's Chicago area home. That time frame can easily shorten to three to five years for those who qualify for a tax credit, he said."}

They would be wrong, experts say. Most, if not all, retirees need stocks — the growth engine of an investment portfolio — to ensure they don't run out of money during a retirement that might last decades, experts said. \"It's important for retirees to have some equities in their portfolio to increase the long-term returns,\" said David Blanchett, head of retirement research for PGIM, an investment management arm of Prudential Financial.\n\nLongevity is biggest financial risk\n\nLongevity risk — the risk of outliving one's savings — is the biggest financial danger for retirees, Blanchett said. The average life span has increased from about 68 years in 1950 to to 78.4 in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What's more, the number of 100-year-olds in the U.S. is expected to quadruple over the next three decades, according to Pew Research Center. Retirees may feel that shifting out of stocks — especially during bouts of volatility like the recent tariff-induced selloff — insulates their portfolio from risk.\n\nwatch now\n\nThey would be correct in one sense: cash and bonds are generally less volatile than stocks and therefore buffer retirees from short-term gyrations in the stock market. Indeed, finance experts recommend dialing back stock exposure over time and boosting allocations to bonds and cash. The thinking is that investors don't want to subject a huge chunk of their portfolio to steep losses if they need to access those funds in the short term. Dialing back too much from stocks, however, poses a risk, too, experts said. More from Personal Finance:\n\nCash may feel safe when stocks slide, but has risks\n\nHow a trade war could impact the price of clothing\n\nIs now a good time to buy gold? Retirees who pare their stock exposure back too much may have a harder time keeping up with inflation and they raise the risk of outliving their savings, Blanchett said. Stocks have had a historical return of about 10% per year, outperforming bonds by about five percentage points, Blanchett said. Of course, this means that over the long term, investing in stocks has yielded higher returns compared to investing in bonds. \"Retirement can last up to three decades or more, meaning your portfolio will still need to grow in order to support you,\" wrote Judith Ward and Roger Young, certified financial planners at T. Rowe Price, an asset manager.\n\nWhat's a good stock allocation for retirees?\n\nSo, what's a good number? One rule of thumb is for investors to subtract their age from 110 or 120 to determine the percentage of their portfolio they should allocate to stocks, Blanchett said. For example, a roughly 50/50 allocation to stocks and bonds would be a reasonable starting point for the typical 65-year-old, he said.\n\nAn investor in their 60s might hold 45% to 65% of their portfolio in stocks; 30% to 50% in bonds; and 0% to 10% in cash, Ward and Young of T. Rowe Price wrote. Someone in their 70s and older might have 30% to 50% in stocks; 40% to 60% in bonds; and 0% to 20% in cash, they said.\n\nWhy your stock allocation may differ\n\nHowever, every investor is different, Blanchett said. They have different abilities to take risk, he said. For example, investors who've saved too much money, or can fund their lifestyles with guaranteed income like pensions and Social Security — can choose to take less risk with their investment portfolios because they don't need the long-term investment growth, Blanchett said.\n\nwatch now\n\nThe less important consideration for investors is risk \"appetite,\" he said. This is essentially their stomach for risk. A retiree who knows they'll panic in a downturn should probably not have more than 50% to 60% in stocks, Blanchett said. The more comfortable with volatility and the better-funded a retiree is, the more aggressive they can be, Blanchett said.\n\nOther key considerations"}

On the economy, however, the survey showed Trump with 43% approval and 55% disapproval, the first time in any CNBC poll that he has been net negative on the economy while president.\n\nTrump's Republican base remains solidly behind him, but Democrats, at -90 net economic approval, are 30 points more negative than their average during his first term, and independents are 23 points more negative. Blue collar workers, who were key to the president's election victory, remain positive on the Trump's handling of the economy, but their disapproval numbers have shot up by 14 points compared to their average for his first term.\n\n\"Donald Trump was reelected specifically to improve the economy, and so far, people are not liking what they're seeing,\" said Jay Campbell, partner with Hart Associates, the Democratic pollster on the survey.\n\nThe poll was conducted April 9 through 13th and has a margin of error of +/-3.1%.\n\nThe results show that Trump has so far been able to convince only his base that his economic policies will be good for the country over time: 49% of the public believe the economy will get worse over the next year, the most pessimistic overall result since 2023. That figure includes 76% of Republicans who see the economy improving. But 83% of Democrats and 54% of independents see the economy getting worse. Among those believing the president's policies will have a positive impact, 27% say it will take a year or longer. However, 40% of those who are negative about the president's policies say they are hurting the economy now.\n\n\"We're in a turbulent, kind of maelstrom of change when it comes to how people feel about what's going to happen next,\" said Micah Roberts, managing partner with Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollsters for the survey. \"The data… suggests more than ever that it's the negative partisan reaction that's driving and sustaining discontent and trepidation about what comes next.\"\n\nWhile partisanship is the most significant part of the president's negative showing, he loses some support among Republicans in key areas like tariffs and inflation, and has seen a notable deterioration among independents.\n\nTariffs look to be a substantial part of the overall public's discontent. Americans disapprove of across-the-board tariffs by a 49 to 35 margin, and majorities believe they are bad for American workers, inflation and the overall economy. Democrats give tariffs a thumbs down by an 83-point margin and independents by 26 points. Republicans approve of the tariffs by a 59-point spread — 20 points below their 79% net approval of the president.\n\nLarge majorities of Americans see Canada, Mexico, the EU and Japan as more of an economic opportunity for the United States rather than an economic threat. In fact, all are viewed more favorably than when CNBC asked the question during Trump's first term. The data suggest the public, including majorities of Republicans, do not embrace the antipathy the president has expressed towards those trading partners. On China, however, the public sees it as a threat by a 44% to 35% margin, substantially worse than when CNBC last asked the question in 2019.\n\nThe president's worst numbers come on his handling of inflation, which the public disapproves of by a 37 to 60% margin, including strong net negatives from Democrats and independents. But at 58%, it's the lowest net positive approval from Republicans for any of the issues asked about the president. 57% of the public believe we will soon be, or are currently in, a recession, up from just 40% in March 2024. The figure includes 12% who think the recession has already begun.\n\nThe public also disapproves of the president's handling of federal government spending by a 45% to 51% and foreign policy by a 42% to 53% margin.\n\nTrump's best numbers come on immigration, where his handling of the Southern border is approved by a 53% to 41% margin, and deportation of illegal immigrants is approved 52% to 45%. The president achieved a slight majority of support from independents on deportations and 22% support from Democrats on the Southern border. While still modest, it's the best-performing issue for Trump among Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans have turned more negative on the stock market than they've been in two years. Some 53% say it's a bad time to invest, with just 38% saying it's a good time. The numbers represent a sharp turnaround from the stock market optimism that greeted the president's election. In fact, the December survey represented the sharpest swing toward market optimism in the survey's 17-year history and the April survey is the sharpest turn towards pessimism.\n\nThe president's troubles with his approval rating do not appear to be translating for now into significant potential gains for Democrats. Asked about congressional preference, 48% of the public support Democratic control and 46% support Republican control, barely changed from CNBC's March 2022 survey.\n\nGet Your Ticket to Pro LIVE\n\nJoin us at the New York Stock Exchange!\n\nUncertain markets?

It is more widely known as the site where many suffragists were held after the Silent Sentinels pickets at the White House in 1917. And according to the Library of Congress, November 14, 1917 is known as the \"Night of Terror\" because of how the suffragist prisoners were mistreated at the prison.\n\nThe Lorton Reformatory was built in 1910 and shut down in 2001. Afro Newspaper/gado | Archive Photos | Getty Images\n\nThe 2,324-acre property, which included a farm, shut down in 2001. The following year, Fairfax County bought the site for $4.2 million. Under the county's ownership, the old prison and grounds became a park, a golf course, three schools, and an arts center. In 2008, the county started working with the Alexander Company, a Wisconsin developer with a history of historic preservation and adaptive reuse. The developer set out to convert the campus into 165 apartments. \"The Lorton Reformatory was a good set of buildings to be converted into residential because it was a reform-era prison,\" David Vos, a development project manager with the Alexander Company, tells CNBC Make It. \"So, unlike most prisons that tend to be large footprint dark buildings without very many windows, these actually had an abundance of light and had quite a bit of character to them, so they laid out very nicely for apartments.\"\n\nRent at the Liberty Crest Apartments ranges from $1,372 to $2,700. Matthew Ritenour for CNBC Make It\n\nThe Liberty Crest Apartments have 165 units — 44 of which are designated affordable, low-income housing. There are 84 one-bedroom and 81 two-bedroom apartments and monthly rent ranges from $1,372 to $2,700. Each apartment is equipped with an in-unit washer and dryer. Renovations took almost two years and roughly $64 million to complete. A majority of the project's funding came from historic tax credits, bond financing, and low-income housing tax credits. Virginia Housing provided the first mortgage for the project and payments are about $125,000 a month. The apartments opened in June 2017 and Vos says all the available units were leased in just a matter of months. The complex has been at full occupancy ever since. \"The reaction from the community varied quite a bit. A lot of people really felt it was important to preserve that history. However, there were people that really focused on the later years of the prison when prisoners were mistreated,\" he says. \"But from our standpoint, we really felt that it's important to preserve history so you can learn from the past so that you don't make those mistakes again in the future.\"\n\n\"There's a number of reminders as you walk around the campus that remind you of the fact that this used to be a reformatory or prison,\" Vos says. Matthew Ritenour for CNBC Make It\n\nSome remnants of the old prison include signs telling visitors and inmates how to behave on the property. \"There's a number of reminders as you walk around the campus that remind you of the fact that this used to be a reformatory or prison,\" Vos says. The name Liberty Crest Apartments is an homage to the property's history: \"The reason we chose Liberty for the name was we really felt that we were liberating these buildings from its more recent dark past.\" The old prison's cafeteria was converted into a community space for residents. Other amenities include a yoga studio, gym, community pool, and two playgrounds.\n\nThe name Liberty Crest Apartments is an homage to the property's history: \"The reason we chose Liberty for the name was we really felt that we were liberating these buildings from its more recent dark past.\" Matthew Ritenour for CNBC Make It\n\nThere is also a field on campus with the original grandstand that was made by the prisoners themselves from bricks. Today, the space is used as an all-purpose area for the residents. The Liberty Crest property also has a preschool, dental office, restaurants, and retail shops. The apartments have been open for almost nine years now and construction on the property is mostly complete. Vos and the Alexander Company are currently focused on converting a power plant that sits on the site into 10 additional apartments. There are plans to transforming the former guard quarters, too.\n\nAmenities at the Liberty Crest Apartments include a yoga studio, gym, community pool, and two playgrounds. Alexander Company"}
